# sql-challenge

This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

In the data modeling section, inspected the CSV files, and then sketched an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables using QuickDBD.

In the data engineering section, used the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. To be more specific, specifing the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. For the primary keys, verified that the column is unique. Otherwise, created a composite key  which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row. Created the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys. Finally, imported each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.
